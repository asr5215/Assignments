	MetaData lookup
	Slack Space Analysis
	Deleted File Recovery

how to find order of created file: modified time/MAC time, or look for fragmentation/if a file points to different blocks and one is now currently being used,
	the fragmented file is first, also if you try to recover a file and you cant it is normally due to overriding
	
use mactime w/ fls gives MAC information

FAT:
	old file system
	simple instruction
	still used with usb
	
FAT12, FAT16, FAT32
ExFAT -> benefits from FAT32 and NTFS structure -> only for windows

Directory: Music
	3 files: song1.mp3, song2.mp3, list.txt
	Boot Sector: FAT is located
					allocation status
					chain of use
				 root directory
				 
Block Music
1) . me
2) .. parent
3) song1.mp3 | start cluster 23 | size 3 MB

FAT Structure
	Why do we need this data structure? -> allows to search for content, unallocated/unallocated, and clusters
	
	FF7 means Bad Cluster
	FF8-FFF means end cluster
	FFF-FFF means EOF
	
FAT16 - max 65,525 clusters
